
GitHub Exercise
Part I

Letâ€™s start by taking a bit of time to practice the git workflow below. It is so valuable to just practice this workflow a couple times, since you will most likely doing it professionally as well as in your individual projects and open source contributions. Here are some things to do.

    Create a local repository and add and commit some files	
	~/GitPractice/index.html
	~/GitPractice/app.js
    Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ cat app.js
		js dummy
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ cat index.html
		index dummy
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git init
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git add .
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git commit -m "1st commit"
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git branch -M main
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git remote add origin https://github.com/p-stern/GitPractice.git
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git push -u origin main
    Create a local branch and add and commit some files
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git checkout -b add-css
	(modified index.html, added app.css)
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git add .
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git commit -m add-css "update index.html, add app.css"
	
    Push that local branch to GitHub to create a remote branch
	pstern@Home:~/GitPractice$ git push origin add-css
	

Part II - Put your memory game on GitHub pages

Using GitHub pages, deploy your memory game from the previous unit so that you can share them with anyone!
